# FRAMGIA TRAINING
## Rails book - Chapter 3
/Heroku demo/: [https://c3-sample-app.herokuapp.com](https://c3-sample-app.herokuapp.com)
**Up and running**
1. Bundle and create database
`bundle`
`rails db:create` `rails db:migrate`
2. Run the server
`rails s`
3. I use RSpec instead of minitest, so you could run test by
`rake spec`
4. I also use Guard for automate test. Execute it by
`bundle exec guard`
